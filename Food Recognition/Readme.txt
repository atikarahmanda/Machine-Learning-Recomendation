This is model for food recognition
We use dataset Food-101 (food images) to detect label of picture, after that we call calorie, carbohydrate, protein and fat of food.

Actually, from dataset have 101 food category, but for efficiency in training and Ram in google collab, because our google collab is not premium, we just use 5 food category.
<br> the 101 food category will use by cloud computing in vertex AI. And the wellness plate application can detect 101 food category

<br> for the result, we have file hdf5, but it is to big to upload in github, so we upload it in drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BnJMd09bGebMhxJ7N3juN_LVbcourHK2?usp=sharing
